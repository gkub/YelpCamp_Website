# YelpCamp Campground-Finding Website

This project was developed by Gregory Kubiski-Moshansky for the Web Developer Bootcamp 2021 on Udemy.

The code won't run without proper .env file configuration, but I wanted to upload the code for my portfolio.

The website is powered by Express, EJS, Express-Session, MongoDB, Passport, and a variety of other libraries.

It allows users to (securely) register accounts, add and remove Campground postings + reviews. User authentication and authorization privileges are implemented, and extensive error-handling encapsulates the site.
